# ROUTERS
# ROUTERS SHOULD IMPORT SCHEMAS NO RE-DEFINE THEM
# ORGANIZE API ENDPOINTS INTO MODULAR, MAINTAINABLE COMPONENTS
# GROUP RELATED ROUTES LOGICALLY (E.G., USERS, ITEMS, LIBRARIES)
# KEEP THE MAIN FASTAPI APP FILE CLEAN AND SIMPLE
# ALLOW INDEPENDENT TESTING AND DEBUGGING OF ROUTE GROUPS
# ENABLE ROUTE PREFIXES AND TAGS FOR CONSISTENT URL STRUCTURE
# FACILITATE DEPENDENCY INJECTION (E.G., DB SESSIONS, AUTH) AT THE ROUTER LEVEL
# ENSURE CONSISTENT REQUEST VALIDATION AND RESPONSE MODELS BY IMPORTING SCHEMAS
# PREVENT SCHEMA DUPLICATION AND MAINTAIN SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
# MAKE SCALING THE BACKEND EASIER BY ADDING NEW ROUTERS WITHOUT CLUTTER
# PROMOTE SEPARATION OF CONCERNS BY KEEPING ROUTES DISTINCT FROM BUSINESS LOGIC
